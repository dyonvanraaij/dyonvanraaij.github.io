          regular coverband, we put on a spectacular,<br />
          high-energy show complete with stage props, effects and on stage
          "Eddie" monsters that simulate a perfect Iron<br />

          a night to remember.<br />

        <p>

          Kloet, Robert-Jan Sips.<br />

          the Dutch author Jan Hendrik Frederik Gronloh.<br />

          international audience was "In the Dutch Mountains"<br />
          (1987).Other well-known Nits songs include "J.O.S. Days", "Adieu,
          Sweet Bahnhof" and "Sketches of Spain".<br />

        <h1>Within Temptation</h1>
        <p>
          Within Temptation is a Dutch symphonic metal band founded in April
          1996 by vocalist Sharon den Adel and <br />
          guitarist Robert Westerholt. They have always been classified by
          critics as gothic metal, although the <br />
          "gothic" influence varies with each album. Their most prominent and
          well-known sound is described as symphonic <br />
          metal, although their earlier material, such as debut album Enter, was
          mostly gothic metal. Enter even had a <br />
          hint of doom metal. In an interview, den Adel said they fell into a
          symphonic rock genre with various influences. <br />
          In a later interview with Dutch music platform 3VOOR12, den Adel
          stated that "we consider ourselves more a <br />
          symphonic rock band ... in my opinion, we are no gothic band". <br />
          After the release of their debut album Enter in 1997, the band became
          prominent in the Dutch underground scene. <br />
          It was not until 2001 that they became known to the general public,
          with the single "Ice Queen" from their second <br />
          album Mother Earth, which reached No. 2 on the Dutch charts. This was
          followed by the band winning the Conamus <br />
          Exportprijs, a Dutch music award, four years in a row, and a fifth in
          2016. Their next albums The Silent Force <br />
          (2004) and The Heart of Everything (2007) debuted at No. 1 on the
          Dutch charts. In 2008, they released a live DVD <br />
          and CD, Black Symphony, recorded with the Metropole Orchestra. This
          was followed in 2009 by An Acoustic Night at <br />
          the Theatre, another live album.<br />
